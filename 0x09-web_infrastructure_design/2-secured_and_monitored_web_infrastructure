 Components:
1. Server 1 (8.8.8.8):  Hosting machine for the entire secured infrastructure.
2. Server 2: Additional server for redundancy and improved availability.
3. Load Balancer (HAproxy):  Distributes incoming requests to the two application servers.
4. Web Server (Nginx):  Handles HTTP requests, serves static content.
5. Application Servers (App1, App2):  Process dynamic content, interact with the application code.
6. Application Files (Code Base): Contains the code for the website.
7. Database (MySQL - Primary & Replica): Primary node for read-write operations and replica node for read-only operations, improving scalability and redundancy.
8. Firewalls (Firewall1, Firewall2, Firewall3):  Added for security, controlling incoming and outgoing traffic.
9. SSL Certificate: To serve www.foobar.com over HTTPS, ensuring encrypted traffic.
10. Monitoring Clients (Client1, Client2, Client3):Data collectors for monitoring services (e.g., Sumologic) as well as collect and analyze performance and security data.

Design Explanation:
1. Additional Elements:
   Firewalls: Added for security to control and monitor incoming and outgoing traffic.
    SSL Certificate: Enables HTTPS to ensure encrypted traffic for secure communication.
   Monitoring Clients: Collect data for performance and security analysis.
2. Reasons for Additional Elements:
   Firewalls: Enhance security by controlling and filtering network traffic.
   SSL Certificate: Secures communication between users and the website.
  Monitoring Clients: Collect and analyze data for proactive issue identification and system improvement.
3. Traffic over HTTPS:
   Why: Ensures encrypted communication, protecting user data from interception.
4. Firewalls:
   Purpose: Control incoming and outgoing traffic, protecting against unauthorized access and potential threats.
5. Monitoring:
   Purpose: Collects performance and security data to identify issues and optimize system performance.
6. Monitoring Data Collection:
   How: Monitoring clients (e.g., Sumologic) collect data on system performance, security, and logs.

7. Monitoring QPS (Queries Per Second):
   How: Configure monitoring tools to track and analyze web server QPS metrics.
Issues with the Infrastructure:
1. Terminating SSL at the Load Balancer Level:
   Issue: The traffic is decrypted at the load balancer, potentially exposing data during internal communication.
2. Single MySQL Server Accepting Writes:
   Issue: Potential single point of failure for write operations, impacting system availability.
3. Identical Components on Servers:
   Issue: Uniformity might lead to vulnerabilities. Diversification can improve security by avoiding a single point of compromise.
